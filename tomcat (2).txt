Install apache tomact, on redhat server.  ipaddress:8080
steps
1.	Go to apache tomcat website, under core, copy tar.gz link address
2.	wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.27/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.27.tar.gz
If wget command is not found , install it by sudo yum install wget or sudo apt-get install
3.	Extract the tar files with the command tar -zvxf apache-tomcat-10.0.27.tar.gz
Now the files are extracted into the folder apache
4.	As the instance is new here, we do not have java here, first we have to install java
So we do sudo yum install java -y or sudo apt-get install java -y  or 
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk because tomcat uses java with it, so java need to be there on the instance
5.	Usually setup files is inside the bin folder, there are two files in it startup.sh and shutdown.sh , so we will have to go bin folder
cd apache-tomcat-10.0.27		ls
cd bin					ls 
execute startup.sh	./startup.sh	The tomcat has started
6.	Go to browser & at the url bar type publicip:8080  example 13.232.88.117:8080
Tomcat apache is launched.
To terminate   ./shutdown.sh
